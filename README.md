# Hardwood Player Predictor

This tool predicts a basketball player's skill ratings at age 22 based on their current and initial values from [onlinecollegebasketball.org](http://onlinecollegebasketball.org).

**Live App:** https://your-app-name.onrender.com  
(Replace with your actual Render URL)

## How It Works

- Paste a player URL like `http://onlinecollegebasketball.org/player/224284`
- The app scrapes:
  - Initial skill values (from age 14)
  - Current skill values
  - Potential rating
- It predicts skill growth up to age 22
- Applies an SI (Skill Index) cap: `SI Cap = Potential Ã— 15.5`
- Displays predicted skill ratings (max 20, rounded down)
